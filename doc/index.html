	<h2>Gform</h2>
	<p>Gform helps you creating forms for your <a href="http://www.dojotoolkit.org">dojo</a> application. Gform is best-suited for administrative frontends that require the user to enter lots of data and the layout does not require any special conversion rate optimization features like fancy visual effects. A gform form is initialized by javascript with a json object and the modified object is read by javascript - e.g. the form can be bound to a dojo store. Posting the gform like an html form is currently not supported.  

The form is created according to your data model's schema and thus he development effort stays constant even for complexe data structures. The main steps to using gform
- provide a schema for you data model. Maybe use one of these tools
- integrate the Editor dijit in you dojo application
- add buttons to load data into the editor
- add uttons to validate and process the editored data.

Steps you don't need to take:
- You don't need to add layouting. THis is taken care of. 
- Validation rules can be defined in the schema.
- 


<a href="http://json-schema.org/">Json schema (v0.3)</a> and gform schema are supported formats. The former is a standard schema for json data and supported by a lot of libraries. The latter is a specialized schema that provides extra information to take advantage of all gform features like 'groups'.</p>
